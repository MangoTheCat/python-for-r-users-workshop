To follow along with the workshop please install the Anaconda distribution in the **Python 3.6 version** from <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>.

You will also need to download all of the data files, in the data directory, to have available during the workshop.

For the final chapter, we mention different packages in Python for you to look into, some of these are not included in Anaconda. To install those, use `pip install <pkg-name>`.
